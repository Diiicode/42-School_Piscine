# 42 Piscine â€” Shell00

This repository contains my solutions for the **Shell00 module** of the 42 Piscine.  
It is the very first step in the Piscine journey, designed to make us comfortable with:

- Working in a UNIX terminal
- Understanding file permissions and attributes
- Navigating the filesystem
- Using `ls`, `cat`, `tar`, `find`, `diff`, etc.
- Writing small shell scripts
- Managing Git basics (`commit`, `ignore`)
- Creating SSH keys
- Using `man` pages as documentation

---

## ðŸ“Œ Goal
The purpose of Shell00 is to build a solid foundation with the **bash shell**.  
Before diving into C programming, Makefiles, and advanced scripting, we must feel at ease with the command line and the logic behind UNIX tools.

## ðŸ“‚ Exercises
Each exercise is inside its own directory (`ex00/`, `ex01/`, â€¦).  
The module covers:

1. **Basic file creation** (`Z`, `testShell00`, `Oh yeah, moooreâ€¦`)
2. **SSH keys** and remote work (`SSH me!`)
3. **Listing and filtering files** (`midLS`)
4. **Git essentials** (`git_commit.sh`, `git_ignore.sh`)
5. **File comparison** (`diff`)
6. **Cleaning scripts** (`clean`)
7. **Magic files** and file type detection (`ft_magic`)

---

## ðŸ›  How to Use
Clone the repo and navigate to each exercise directory.  
Run the commands or scripts. 
Most scripts should run in `/bin/sh`.

Example:
```bash
cd ex05
bash git_commit.sh
