# 42 Lisboa Piscine

This repository contains my work from the **42 Lisboa Piscine**, an intensive 4-week bootcamp focused on learning programming fundamentals through peer-to-peer learning and project-based challenges.

## 📚 Contents
- **C Programming**: syntax, pointers, memory management, recursion, algorithms  
- **Projects**: progressively harder challenges designed to build strong problem-solving skills  

## 🛠️ Focus
The majority of this repository is dedicated to **C projects**, covering:
- String manipulation  
- Memory allocation  
- Pointers and arrays  
- Recursion and algorithms

# 42 Piscine
> A curated map for future Pisciners — exercises, guides, rush examples, exam practice, and tools.

- 🧭 Start here: Shell00 → Shell01 → C00…C13
- 🧪 Exam prep: simulators & walkthroughs
- 🧰 Tools: norminette, valgrind, gdb, Makefiles
