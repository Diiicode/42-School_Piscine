# 42 Lisboa Piscine **work in progress

This repository contains my work from the **42 Lisboa Piscine**, an intensive 4-week bootcamp focused on learning programming fundamentals through peer-to-peer learning and project-based challenges.

## 📚 Contents
- **C Programming**: syntax, pointers, memory management, recursion, algorithms  
- **Projects**: progressively harder challenges designed to build strong problem-solving skills  

## 🛠️ Focus
The majority of this repository is dedicated to **C projects**, covering:
- String manipulation  
- Memory allocation  
- Pointers and arrays  
- Recursion and algorithms  

## 🌍 About 42
[42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) is a global programming school with a unique peer-to-peer, project-driven learning methodology. The Piscine is the entry test, designed to push students to their limits and foster collaboration, autonomy, and resilience.
